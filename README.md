# Korg-DW6000-editor
A built in sysex ecitor for the Korg DW6000 wavetable synthesizer

I picked up a broken Korg DW6000 for Â£100 a few months back, fixed it fairly quickly with a broken logic chip.

Back in the 80's I wrote an editor for the DW on my Amstrad CPC 6128, well computers have come a long way since then and a Teensy 4.1 probably has more power than the CPC6128 and certainly more RAM.

So I thought it would be good to build a hardware editor directly into the synth for each parameter and store them in memory. Also add an OLED display to show what is being edited.

The editor board was a sandwich of proto board to get the spacing almost right to fit the pots where the numbers were for each parameter, everything is mounted on a single board and intercepts the incoming MIDI and adds usbMIDI support. Plus each parameter is now mapped to an incoming CC message for easier editing from a DAW etc.

* 999 Memories
* USB to MIDI
* CC message control
* Master control sends all params for each patch from memory to the DW.
* slave mode, edits the DWs own patches.
